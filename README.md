# e-LearningPlatform

This is an e-Learning platform that was developed as a prototype for a local startup. The intent of the web application is to function as an online tool where users can takes courses, interact with instructors/peers and create personalized schedules for themselves. 

Attached is a demo of the portion I focused on which is a calendar that allowed users to select dates and add events to that date. These events would then appear in the details for that date.
